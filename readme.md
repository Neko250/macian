# Macian

![MIT](https://joshavanier.github.io/badges/mit.svg)

A CSS framework inspired by and based on [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/)

## Purpose

Macian was created to be a framework that is suited to my own personal preferences.

## Goals

My goal with Macian is to create a lightweight and versatile CSS framework to simplify the process of web development as well as to provide consistency across my web creations.

## Credits

As mentioned, Macian is a product of inspiration and would not be possible if not for the existence of

Tachyons
